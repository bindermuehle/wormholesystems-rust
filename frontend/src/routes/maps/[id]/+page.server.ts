// of a beat later, and the canvas is never drawn on the built-in grid first. `MapState`
// starts from all of it and takes over.
//
// The graph is the one part the page cannot do without: a map that is gone, was never
// shared with this visitor, or a backend that is down ends on the error page that says
// which, with the status that goes with it. The rest only fall back to the client.
